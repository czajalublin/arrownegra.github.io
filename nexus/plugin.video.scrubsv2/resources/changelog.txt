[B]- 5.0.28[/B] Modified the addon so script.scrubsv2.artwork is a Optional Install with it in that menu section, a popup to install on first runs like fresh installs and updates, plus a setting to disable the popup if the artwork isnt installed. (All of this should be unused code and not seen when the artwork is installed.) Recoded all the scrapers to use the match alias and match year defs for better results. (hopefully lol) Also did a full scraper check/cleanup and added some quality scrapes where possible. (likely not accurate lol.)

Added in a new scraper i made.(watchserieshdstream) Made and added in a new iptv indexer for UStvGO.(So far.)(Some channels fail to find the link which makes my new random channel option suck a little but enjoy anyways lol.) Also modified the quality, info, and filetype defs to try and refine the results better.
[B]- 5.0.12[/B] Ditched the myvideolinks scraper/provider due to its faulty search. refined the quality coding a bit more to reduce the fake 4k's.
[B]- 5.0.13[/B] Made another iptv bit called UStv247 thats a UStvGO clone. Decided to swap the quality code back to a older version and updated the addon to use it too.(Quality settings changed.)(let me know if there is any errors.)

[B]- 5.0.18[/B] Changed some stuff in the ShadowNet section to try and improve it, removed artwork also since it didnt load properly anyways. Removed most of my forced cookie code from the scrapers to improve scrape time, if there are errors due to this change i will deal with them later lol.

[B]- 5.0.22[/B] Fixed a little trakt code that was making some userlists error out. Removed "Watch [Show] Online" and "ShadowNet" from the More Stuff section because they both suck now and im not interested in fixing them up lol.
[B]- 5.0.23[/B] Changed up the "Episodes (Widget)" and its setting, everyone probably needs to update this now on their devices. Added another site for iptv stuff called "WatchYourTV". Removed the IPTV items i been working on like the canada list, its all now in its own addon called plugin.video.json_iptv i tossed together for testing. Updated the url for the youtube addon play code which is used for trailers.(Might cause problems with kodi versions below v18 or v19.)

[B]- 5.0.24[/B] Added a new setting to toggle the &/and replacement for item titles. (so you can search for like Law and Order or Law & Order)  Applied some changes to the main.py with a new system.router process, was a suggested change but not sure of its pros/cons. (Doesnt seem any slower of faster to me but will swap it back if anyone wants.) Fixed some 2embed code for sources. Updated my custom host swaps for dood to fix the 4 known bad domains.
